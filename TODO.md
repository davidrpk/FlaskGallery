* Use ORM (maybe SQLAlchemy) for SQLite connection. This would make it easier to extend to other dbs
* Image proxy for accessing files from Azure blob storage
* Pagination to break huge photo lists up
* Use taken date to structure photos into easily browsable pages
* Display all meta data on image page
* Better test coverage :)
